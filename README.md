**Intraduction**

Here is a collection of useful scripts I've gathered over the years. There are also comments and guidance in the files to try and help with using them.


**Comments**

Comments are present in the scripts either on their own line or at the end of the code on the same line.
The comments can be recognized by having two slashes ("//") ahead of them. 
The comments wont have an effect on code in seperate files, but has to be removed if used in a mission file in a trigger, unit, ect.


**Variable name**

![variable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4792f2-f38d-44c5-9a1d-09a9c66416f5)

The variable name can be found near the top of the attributes of a unit or object.
It is used to give a specific identifier to a unit or object that can be refered to by other scripts or modules.
